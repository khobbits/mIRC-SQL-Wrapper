iDM Mysql wrapper.

I was asked to make a copy of the mysql accessor script I was using available for public use.
This script provides some basic ini/hash like commands for accessing data in a mysql database.

The original mysql dll contact information is found below.


==Author==
This mirc script was written by KHobbits in attempt to make the usage of sql queries more efficent in a specific application.
This script is used in iDM, an IRC deathmatch bot.
You can contact me on #KH @ irc.swiftirc.net.


==Usage==
This script works alongside with the original mirc dll, and the mirc script provided by ramirez.

After filling in your database details and setting up a sql database for your purpose,
you can use the alias's provided to allow easy access to the data within.

The methods used within work best when you use a primary key for nagivation.

There are a couple of things you will probably want to edit.  
Replacing the default database details with your own
Replacing 'putlog' with something more appropriate to your project
Replacing the debug lines with something more appropriate to your project
